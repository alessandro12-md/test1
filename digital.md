# Digital Painting

Digital painting allows me to explore light and composition in a different way.  
This page gathers some of my digital works.

## About this medium

I create most of my digital paintings using [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), an open-source software designed for artists.

<br>


What I enjoy most about digital painting is the **feeling of total freedom**, I can explore, adjust, and transform my work endlessly.  
There is also a comforting sense of **being allowed to make mistakes**, knowing that nothing is permanent and everything can be revised.
