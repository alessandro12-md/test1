# Acrylics

Acrylic paint is made from three main elements: pigment, water, and an acrylic polymer that acts as a binder.
When the water evaporates, the polymer forms a thin, flexible film that holds the colour in place.  

This page gathers some of my acrylic works.

## About this medium

What I appreciate most about acrylic paint is its **fast drying time** — it allows me to work in layers and experiment freely with colours and textures.  
Acrylics make it possible to move quickly between ideas, to build up depth or erase almost instantly.

Some of the painters who inspire me most are [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh), [Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet), and [Théodore Gudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Gudin).
