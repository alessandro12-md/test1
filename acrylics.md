# Acrylics 

Acrylic paint is made from three main elements: pigment, water, and an acrylic polymer that acts as a binder.
When the water evaporates, the polymer forms a thin, flexible film that holds the colour in place.

## About this medium

What I appreciate most about acrylic paint is its **fast drying time**, it allows me to work in layers and experiment freely with colours and textures.  
Acrylics make it possible to move quickly between ideas and to build up depth.

<br>

Some of the painters who inspire me most are [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh), [Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet), and [Théodore Gudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Gudin).
