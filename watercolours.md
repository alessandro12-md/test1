# Watercolours

Watercolour painting allows subtle transitions of light and colour — a balance between control and spontaneity.  
This page gathers some of my recent works.

## About this medium

One of my favourite painters, [J.M.W. Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner), was a great master of watercolour.  
He used this medium to explore light, atmosphere, and movement, creating works that still feel alive today.
His approach reminds me that watercolour can be both delicate and powerful.
